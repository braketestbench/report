With the evolution of the automotive industry, vehicles come out of the factory each time with more power and faster top speeds. Along with this enhancement in performance the concern in effectiviness of brake systems should also increase.
\par
There are already consolidated standards rules for brake system testing, this project is focused with respect to \textit{SAE J2522} regulation that addresses on brakes tests on passenger vehicles. 
\par
This paper aims to study the major factors regarding brake tests and electronic instrumentation in order to develop a electronic instrument system for automation of a testbench used to perform brake tests. The major output of the project is to design a electronic system able to measure all the relevant physical data and to control the needed actuators.
