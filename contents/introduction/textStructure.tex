	The rest of this thesys was divided on chapters briefly explained bellow.
	
	\textbf{Chapter 2, Literature Review: } This chapter will explore somo concepts and aspects of engineering and of brake tests that are considered fundamental to following parts of this paper.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 3, Methodology: }
	This is the where the strategy for developing this paper and the engineering solutions it proposes are dicussed.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 4, Acquisition and Control System: }
	On this chapter the problem this project tries to solve will be defined in a specific way and the project requirements, both from hardware and software will be enumerated. Also, based on this requirements the parameters and the proposed solutions will be discussed.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 5, Experimental Tests: }
	As the title already states, this chapter will deal with the experimental tests needed to validate the developed solution.
	\par
	
	\textbf{Chapter 6, Conclusions and Future Endavours: }
	This chapter is debate among the possible conclusions that can be made after the development of this project and will also deal with the possible improvements and uses for the development solution.
