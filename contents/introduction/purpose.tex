\section{Purpose of the project}\label{sec:purpose}
	The purpose of this project is to develop, implement and test an electronic instrument system for monitoring and controlling a small scale brake-testbench based on the information from the internationl regulation \textit{SAE J2522} \cite{sae}. The system should be able to perform brake tests by controlling the mechanical parts while acquiring relevant data with the aid of sensors and transducers.
