\chapter{Experimental Tests}\label{ch:experimentalTests}
		After the board assembly and fabrication phases were finished to ensure that this project attends its requirements. This chapter presents the experimental procedure, the results as well with the discussion and possible improovements. This chapter can be divided in two parts, Section \ref{sec:channels-tests}, \textit{Hardware Interfaces Test}, will deal with the test of each acquisition channel and with the two analog outputs. Section \ref{sec:brake-test}, \textit{Brake Test}, deals with the tests with the materials from \textit{Laboratory of Wear of Materials}, this tests aim to validate the hardware solution as a whole.

		The experimental procedure is based on the brake test procedures proposed by \cite{saej2522} described in Section \ref{ssec:brake-tests}. Basically the test will compreheend turning the electric motor on (with the aid of the frequency inverter) and by monitoring the Speed Acquisition Channel (check Section \ref{sec:speed-acquisition-channel}) wait until the rotor frequency reaches a pre-defined upper limit and then after a configured delay time, stop accelerating the motor and starts to brake until the system reaches a lower speed limit. During the entire procedure the brake pressure, and the temperature on the disc shall be measured. This procedure should be repeated for a set number of times called snubs.
